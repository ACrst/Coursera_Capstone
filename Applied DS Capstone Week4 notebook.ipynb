    "The chosen data focusses on the location coordinates in the different boroughs in the city of Toronto. A lot of venues available by pin code would mean that the area or locality could be densely populated to offer a lot of options for a customer to dine. User reviews and pin codes to a location play an important role to help a new diner decide a place of dining in the new area. This project can help a new resident in a hometown understand the city of Toronto better to understand what Indian food venues are offered in their surroundings. This can also be expanded to provide a better view of other cuisines other than Indian food, as well as other venues such as recreational parks and hospitals."
